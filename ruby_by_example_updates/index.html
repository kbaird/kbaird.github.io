<blockquote>
If you’ve already got some programming experience under your belt and are searching for a book that’ll get you up to
speed with Ruby very quickly, I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593271484?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kevinbanet-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1593271484"><cite>Ruby by Example</cite></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=kevinbanet-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1593271484" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important; width: 1px; height: 1px;" />
(written by Kevin Baird and published by No Starch Press, whose books on coding have impressed me)...
Any introductory material is saved for topics that might be new even to experienced programmers, such as chapter 6's —
<cite>Functionalism with Blocks and Procs</cite> —
<strong>which may represent some of the best coverage of the topic in any Ruby book</strong>.

<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2007/091101-ruby-by-example.html?page=1">
a positive review of <cite>Ruby By Example</cite> by Brian Tanaka of LinuxWorld</a> in which he states
<q>Baird knows his stuff, and his writing style combined with his passion for the topic and an exuberant
sense of adventure make the book feel personal and engaging -- not dry and stiff.</q>

I was recently interviewed for a Dr. Dobb's podcast about

There is also a very positive <a
href="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/content/view/128840/171/">review of <cite>Ruby by Example</cite>
at LinuxSecurity.com</a> that states:
<q>If you love your scripting languages served with a burst of lambdas and proc objects, or you're a fan of
Haskell and Lisp, this book is for you.</q> (Review by Eckie Silapaswang).

<strong>Two Degrees of Separation: </strong>
I find this story interesting. You may or may not. Giles Bowkett (above) seems to like my book, and his blog
states that he was introduced to it by <a href="http://weblog.clintonrnixon.net/">Clinton R. Nixon</a> at OSCON.
As it turns out, Mr. Nixon and I have a mutual friend in
<a href="http://lumpley.com/">D. Vincent Baker</a>, who I had just given a copy of my book to. I assumed that
Vincent had recommended the book to Clinton, and emailed him to thank him for that. But I was mistaken - Clinton had
discovered the book independently. I'm very pleased that Clinton found value in the book enough to suggest it to
others, and thank him for that.
